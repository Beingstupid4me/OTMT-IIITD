            At the Office of Technology Management and Transfer (OTMT), we serve
            as the critical bridge between the cutting-edge research conducted
            at IIIT Delhi and the world of commercialization and industry
            collaboration. While the groundbreaking research happens at IIIT
            Delhi, our role is to ensure that these innovations are identified,
            nurtured, and successfully transferred to the marketplace where they
            can create real impact. We are committed to fostering collaboration
            between researchers, industry leaders, and entrepreneurs to help
            transform research outcomes into commercial products, services, and
            technologies that drive societal and economic progress.
